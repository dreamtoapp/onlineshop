Yes, you can use Prisma in a single codebase to serve many clients, each with their own database. This is a common multi-tenant scenario, and Prisma supports it by allowing you to dynamically instantiate a Prisma Client with a different database connection string for each client at runtime.

**How it works:**

- You do **not** need to generate a separate Prisma Client for each database if the schema is the same.
- Instead, you dynamically create a Prisma Client instance with the correct connection string for each request or client.

**Example approach:**

```ts
// lib/prismaDynamic.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

type TenantConfig = {
  databaseUrl: string;
};

export function createPrismaClient(config: TenantConfig): PrismaClient {
  return new PrismaClient({
    datasources: {
      db: {
        url: config.databaseUrl,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

You can then use this factory function in your API routes or server functions. For example, when a request comes in, you determine which client (tenant) is making the request, fetch their database URL (from a master DB or config), and create a Prisma Client for that request:

```ts
import { createPrismaClient } from "@/lib/prismaDynamic";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const tenantDbUrl = getTenantDbUrlFromRequest(req); // implement this
  const prisma = createPrismaClient({ databaseUrl: tenantDbUrl });

  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  res.json(users);
}
```

**Important notes:**
- You must manage the lifecycle of these Prisma Client instances to avoid resource exhaustion (e.g., too many open connections) [see official guidance](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/help-and-troubleshooting/nextjs-help#handling-dynamic-scenarios).
- This approach is officially documented and recommended for tenant-per-database scenarios with a shared codebase, as long as the schema is the same for all tenants [source](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/help-and-troubleshooting/nextjs-help#handling-dynamic-scenarios).
- There is no need to generate multiple Prisma Clients if the schema is identical; you only need to provide the correct connection string at runtime.

If you have hundreds or thousands of tenants, consider caching or pooling client instances carefully, as each instance maintains its own connection pool and can consume resources [source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/20920).

**Summary:**  
You can serve many clients with one codebase and Prisma by dynamically creating a Prisma Client with the correct database URL for each client at runtime. This is a supported and documented pattern for multi-tenant applications with a tenant-per-database architecture.
