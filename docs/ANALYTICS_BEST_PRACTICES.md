# üìä Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Integration: Best Practices & Action Plan

## ‚úÖ Current State

- **Official Next.js integration:**  
  Using `@next/third-parties/google` in `app/layout.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  <GoogleAnalytics gaId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID || ''} />
  ```
- **Measurement ID** is set via `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`.
- **No manual `<script>` tags** for GA4.
- **No blocking or synchronous analytics scripts**.
- **Custom analytics hook** (`hooks/use-analytics.ts`) wraps `sendGAEvent` for e-commerce and custom events.
- **Automatic pageview tracking** is enabled.
- **Performance optimizations**: DNS prefetch, async loading, web-vitals collection.
- **Documentation**: `ANALYTICS_SETUP.md` is clear and up to date.

## üõ†Ô∏è Action Plan

### 1. **Maintain Best Practices**
- [x] Use only the official Next.js GA4 integration (`@next/third-parties/google`).
- [x] Set Measurement ID via environment variable.
- [x] Avoid manual or blocking analytics scripts.
- [x] Use the custom analytics hook for all event tracking.
- [x] Keep documentation (`ANALYTICS_SETUP.md`) up to date.
- [x] Ensure `.env.example` includes the GA4 variable.

### 2. **Ongoing Maintenance**
- [ ] Regularly review analytics events for business alignment.
- [ ] Monitor for updates to Next.js and analytics packages.
- [ ] Audit for accidental manual script tags or legacy code.
- [ ] Test analytics in production (use GA4 DebugView & Realtime).

### 3. **Adding Custom Events**
Example:
```tsx
import { useAnalytics } from '@/hooks/use-analytics';
const analytics = useAnalytics();

function handleWishlist(product) {
  analytics.trackEvent('add_to_wishlist', { product_id: product.id });
}
```

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance

To ensure your analytics remain accurate, performant, and secure, follow these ongoing maintenance steps:

### 1. **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date**
- Regularly update `@next/third-parties` and Next.js to the latest stable versions.
- Review [Next.js release notes](https://nextjs.org/docs/changelog) and [@next/third-parties changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/third-parties) for analytics-related updates.

### 2. **Validate Measurement ID**
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` is set in `.env.local` and matches your GA4 property.
- Remove any unused or legacy analytics IDs from all environment files.

### 3. **Audit for Legacy or Duplicate Analytics Code**
- Search for and remove any manual `<script>` tags, `window.gtag`, or legacy analytics libraries (e.g., `react-ga`, `analytics.js`).
- Confirm only the official `<GoogleAnalytics />` component is used for tracking.

### 4. **Test Event Tracking**
- Use the [GA4 DebugView](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7201382) to verify events are firing as expected.
- Periodically test custom events (e.g., product clicks, add-to-cart) using your analytics hook.

### 5. **Monitor Performance**
- Check for any analytics-related warnings in browser DevTools and Next.js build logs.
- Ensure analytics scripts are loaded asynchronously and do not block rendering.

### 6. **Review Documentation**
- Keep `ANALYTICS_SETUP.md` and this file up-to-date with any changes to your analytics implementation.
- Document any new custom events or tracking requirements.

### 7. **Security & Privacy**
- Review your privacy policy to ensure it reflects your analytics usage.
- Confirm compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.
- Provide users with a way to opt out of analytics tracking if required.

### 8. **Team Awareness**
- Share this document with all developers and stakeholders.
- Review analytics best practices during onboarding and code reviews.
