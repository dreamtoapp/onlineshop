# â™¿ Accessibility 100% Action Plan

## Goal
Achieve a perfect Lighthouse accessibility score (100) by addressing all critical and recommended issues found in audits and codebase review.

---

## 1. **ARIA Roles & Structure**
- [x] Refactor all elements with `role="grid"` to ensure correct child structure: `grid` > `row` > `gridcell`. *(Done: ProductInfiniteGrid now uses semantic HTML <ul>/<li> instead of ARIA grid roles)*
- [ ] Only use ARIA roles when necessary; prefer semantic HTML.
- [ ] Review all custom roles and remove/replace with semantic tags where possible.

## 2. **Alt Text & Image Accessibility**
- [x] Ensure every `<img>` and `<Image />` has a meaningful `alt` attribute. *(Done: All images have meaningful alt attributes or appropriate fallbacks)*
- [x] Add descriptive `alt` text for all product, category, offer, and avatar images. *(Done)*
- [x] Use empty `alt` (alt="") for decorative images. *(Done where appropriate)*

## 3. **Button & Link Names**
- [x] All `<button>` and `<a>` elements must have visible text or `aria-label`. *(Done: All buttons and links have visible text or accessible names as needed)*
- [x] Add `aria-label` or `title` to icon-only buttons/links (e.g., search, wishlist, cart). *(Done)*
- [x] Ensure all links have discernible names (no empty or icon-only links). *(Done)*

## 4. **Color Contrast**
- [x] Audit all badges, buttons, and text for at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio. *(Done: All UI uses semantic color tokens and meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements in both light and dark modes)*
- [x] Adjust foreground/background colors in Tailwind config or CSS as needed. *(Done)*
- [x] Add high contrast mode support (see `CriticalCSS.tsx` for media queries). *(Done)*

## 5. **Keyboard Navigation & Focus**
- [x] All interactive elements are focusable and support keyboard navigation (tab, enter, space). *(Done: All buttons, links, and custom controls are focusable and keyboard accessible)*
- [x] Visible focus indicators are present for all interactive elements. *(Done: Focus rings and outlines are implemented via Tailwind and custom CSS)*
- [x] No keyboard traps or inaccessible widgets found. *(Done)*

## 6. **Form Labels & ARIA**
- [x] All form fields have associated labels (using htmlFor or aria-label). *(Done: All inputs, selects, and textareas are properly labeled)*
- [x] ARIA attributes are used where needed for accessibility (aria-label, aria-describedby, aria-invalid, etc). *(Done)*

## 7. **Headings & Landmarks**
- [x] All pages use a clear heading structure (h1-h6) for content hierarchy. *(Done: Headings are present and follow a logical order)*
- [x] Semantic landmark elements (main, nav, header, footer, aside) are used for navigation and structure. *(Done: All layouts and major sections use semantic landmarks)*

## 8. **Screen Reader Testing**
- [x] All critical flows and UI have been tested with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, ChromeVox) and are fully accessible. *(Done: No blocking issues found in screen reader testing)*

## 9. **Footer Social Links & Contrast**
- [x] All icon-only social/media links in the footer have descriptive aria-labels. *(Done)*
- [x] All low-contrast text in the footer uses accessible color classes. *(Done: text-secondary replaced with text-foreground)*

## 10. **Status Tabs & Badges Colors**
- [x] All status tabs and badges use semantic color tokens for proper contrast and accessibility. *(Done: OrderStatusTabs and ReplyCountBadge updated)*

## 11. **Final Contrast & Accessible Name Fixes**
- [x] All remaining color contrast issues (badges, buttons, newsletter, etc.) are fixed using semantic color tokens.
- [x] All label/content name mismatches are resolved: aria-labels removed or updated to match visible text, product cards and buttons use visible text for accessibility.
