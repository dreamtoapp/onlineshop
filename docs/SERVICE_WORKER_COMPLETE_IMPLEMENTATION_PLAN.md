# ðŸš€ Service Worker & Push Notification Roadmap

A clear, actionable plan for adding push notifications and background driver tracking to your Next.js PWA.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**
- Customer receives order status notifications (push + in-app)
- Driver location tracked during delivery (background)
- Admin can view latest driver location (on demand)
- PWA features remain fully functional
- Solution is safe, maintainable, and reversible

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Professional Recommendation: Addon Approach**
- Add push notification logic as an addon to your existing service worker
- No breaking changes to PWA or caching
- 100% safe, quick, and reversible

## ðŸ“‹ **Phases & Steps**

### **TODO: Driver Notification on Assignment**
- [ ] Implement driver notification (in-app and push) when they are assigned to a new order

### **1. Preparation**
- [x] Install `web-push` and types
- [x] Generate and save VAPID keys in `.env.local`
- [x] Add your contact email for VAPID

### **2. Database & API**
- [x] Add `PushSubscription` model to your database
- [x] Add/update API endpoint to store push subscriptions
- [x] Add/update API endpoint for driver location updates
- [x] Add API for admin to fetch latest driver location

### **3. Service Worker & PWA**
- [x] Create a push notification addon file (e.g., `sw-notifications-addon.js`)
- [x] Import this addon in your main `sw.js` using `importScripts()`
- [x] Ensure all PWA features and caching remain unchanged

### **4. Frontend Integration**
- [x] Add logic to request notification permission from users
- [x] Subscribe users to push and send subscription to backend
- [x] Add UI for drivers to start/stop location tracking
- [x] Show a persistent reminder to drivers: "Do not close the browser during delivery."

### **5. Notification & Tracking Logic**
- [x] Trigger notifications for order status changes (assignment, trip start, delivery)
- [x] Update driver location in the background during active trips
- [x] Admin dashboard fetches and displays latest driver location on request

### **6. Testing & Validation**
#### **Push Notifications**
- [ ] Trigger an order status change (assignment, trip start, delivery) and confirm:
  - [ ] Notification appears when browser is open
  - [ ] Notification appears when browser is minimized
  - [ ] Notification appears when browser is closed (but running in background)
  - [ ] Clicking the notification opens the correct page

#### **Driver Location Tracking**
- [ ] Start a trip as a driver and:
  - [ ] Move the device or simulate location changes
  - [ ] Confirm location updates are sent to the backend at regular intervals
  - [ ] End the trip and confirm updates stop

#### **Admin Location Lookup**
- [ ] As admin, open the dashboard and:
  - [ ] Select a driver on an active trip
  - [ ] Fetch the latest location using the admin API or UI
  - [ ] Confirm the location matches the most recent update from the driver
  - [ ] Location is displayed clearly (on a map or as coordinates)

#### **PWA Features**
- [ ] Test offline support (disconnect from internet, confirm app loads cached pages/assets)
- [ ] Test installability (install as PWA on desktop/mobile, confirm it works)
- [ ] Test caching (reload pages, confirm assets are loaded from cache when offline)

### **7. Q&A and Final Review**
- [ ] List and resolve any open questions or concerns
- [ ] Adjust plan if needed before implementation
- [ ] Make final go/no-go decision

---

## âœ… **Success Criteria**
- All notification and tracking features work as intended
- No loss of PWA/offline functionality
- Drivers and admins have a clear, reliable experience
- Implementation is maintainable and easy to roll back if needed
