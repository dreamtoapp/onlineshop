# ProductInfiniteGrid Infinite Scroll Report

## 1. Current Implementation Review

### Strengths
- Uses `react-intersection-observer` for viewport detection (efficient).
- Handles loading, error, and empty states.
- Appends new products to the list.
- Updates URL with current page.

### Weaknesses
- Too many network requests due to effect dependencies.
- No debounce/throttle on observer triggers.
- No request deduplication or aborting in-flight requests.
- No caching of fetched pages.
- No prefetching of next page.
- No skeletons for each page load.

## 2. Best Practices (Official Docs & Big Companies)

| Feature                | Your Code | Best Practice (Docs/BigCo) | Recommendation         |
|------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Intersection Observer  | Yes       | Yes                        | Debounce triggers     |
| Caching                | No        | Yes                        | Use SWR/React Query   |
| AbortController        | No        | Yes                        | Add abort logic       |
| Deduplication          | No        | Yes                        | Use SWR/React Query   |
| Prefetch Next Page     | No        | Yes                        | Add prefetch logic    |
| Virtualization         | No        | Yes (for huge lists)       | Use react-window      |
| Stable Keys            | Partial   | Yes                        | Use product.id        |
| Skeletons per page     | No        | Yes                        | Add per-page skeleton |
| URL update             | Yes       | Sometimes                  | Only if needed        |

- **React/Next.js Docs:** Recommend SWR/React Query for infinite scroll, aborting, caching, deduplication, prefetching.
- **Big Companies:** Use request deduplication, aborting, caching, virtualization for large lists, and stable keys.

## 3. Recommendations

1. **Use SWR or React Query** for infinite scroll: handles caching, deduplication, aborting, and pagination.
2. **Debounce intersection observer** triggers to avoid rapid requests.
3. **Abort stale requests** using AbortController.
4. **Cache fetched pages** to avoid refetching.
5. **Prefetch next page** when user is near the end.
6. **Use stable keys** (product.id) for list items.
7. **Virtualize large lists** with react-window if needed.
8. **Update URL only if needed** for deep linking.
9. **Show skeletons for each page** while loading.

## 5. Summary

Your implementation works but can be improved for stability and performance. Using SWR or React Query will reduce network requests, improve caching, and make the scroll more robust. Debounce triggers, abort stale requests, and consider virtualization for very large lists.
