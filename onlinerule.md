# Driver Area Refactor: Actionable TODOs

> **ðŸš¨ STRICT LIVE APP RULES (MANDATORY) ðŸš¨**
>
> - The app is live with 1500+ active users. Every update is high risk.
> - **NO unrelated code changes.** Only touch code directly related to the driver refactor.
> - **ZERO tolerance for errors or crashes.** All changes must be tested and verified before deployment.
> - **Do NOT refactor, optimize, or "improve" code outside the scope of this plan.**
> - **If unsure, STOP and ask for clarification before making any change.**
> - All code must be reviewed and tested in a staging environment before going live.
>
> **This rule is for both AI and human developers. Violating it can cause major business risk.**
