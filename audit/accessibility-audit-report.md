## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ARIA Roles and Structure
- Elements with `role="grid"` are missing required child roles (should have `row` > `gridcell` structure).
- Elements with `role="gridcell"` are not inside a parent with `role="row"`.

### 2. Button Accessibility
- Some `<button>` elements do not have accessible names (no text, `aria-label`, or `title`).

### 3. Color Contrast
- Several elements (badges, buttons, text) have insufficient color contrast (should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text).

### 4. Link Accessibility
- Some `<a>` elements do not have discernible names (no text or `aria-label`).

### 5. Label/Content Name Mismatch
- Some elements with visible text do not have matching accessible names (e.g., search button).

## Prioritized Recommendations

1. **Fix ARIA attributes and roles**
   - Use correct ARIA structure for grids: `grid` > `row` > `gridcell`.
   - Do not assign ARIA roles unless necessary.
2. **Add proper labels to all interactive elements**
   - Ensure all buttons and links have visible text or `aria-label`.
3. **Improve color contrast**
   - Adjust foreground/background colors for badges, buttons, and text to meet WCAG contrast ratios.
4. **Fix link and button accessibility**
   - All links and buttons must have accessible names (text or `aria-label`).
5. **Review hidden/visually hidden content**
   - Ensure all visible labels are included in accessible names.
