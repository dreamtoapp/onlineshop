## Migration Steps

1. Replace all imports of `next/link` with your custom link component as shown above.
2. Ensure all usages of `<Link ...>` are compatible with your custom componentâ€™s props.
3. Test navigation and prefetching behavior in your app to confirm everything works as expected.

**Tip:** Your custom link component optimizes prefetching and is fully compatible with Next.js navigation.
